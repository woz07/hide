### How to delete properly
In order to delete the app properly, you need to delete the exe/jar, whichever you choose to install, and then also ensure that you also delete the `hide` folder within your AppData folder which you can get to by typing `Run` into the windows search bar and then typing in `%APPDATA%` then searching for the hide folder and deleting it.
